# üí´ About Me:
I am a senior computer science student at Oregon State University, passionate about exploring topics of full-stack development, machine learning, and building robust applications.

## üöÄ What I'm Up To

- ü§ñ Exploring Machine Learning with [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/)
- üíª Building Spring Boot applications with PostgreSQL

## üéì My Background

I am currently studying CS at Oregon State. Prior to beginning my degree there, I received a Bachelors of Science in Biology at Ramapo College of NJ. During my senior year, I learned about computational methods within Biology, and was fascinated about the possibilites CS holds. I began to self teach, until I felt prepared to return to school. Since starting, I have completed coursework in classes like Data Structures and Algorithms, Software Engineering, Introduction to Databases, Web Development, Computer Architecture and Assembly, Parallel Programming, and Operating Systems.
